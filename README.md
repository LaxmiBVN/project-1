docker implementation <br/>
I have written a simple calculator application in python. The application takes two integers and the operators(+, -, *, /) to perform the user requested arithmetic. 
The application performs four different arithmetic operations.
I have uploaded my files on the docker hub. To access these files the following command needs to be used from the terminal: <br/>
docker pull lakshmi67/calculator <br/>
To run:<br/>
docker run -d -p 8081:5000 lakshmi67/calculator <br/>
container port: 5000 <br/>
external port: 8081
