docker implementation <br/>
I have written a simple calculator application in python. The application takes two integers and the operators(+, -, *, /) to perform the user requested arithmetic. 
The application performs four different arithmetic operations.
I have uploaded my files on the docker hub. To access these files the following command needs to be used from the terminal:
docker pull lakshmi67/calculator
To run:
docker run -d -p 8081:5000 lakshmi67/calculator
